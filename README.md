# CG-python-labs
 
 # prerequisites:

* Install python 3.9 on your machine and configure it to run in terminal

* Install and configure text editor of your choise to serve as an environment for your programming 

Are you done with this exercise? This exercise might be hard for you depending on your familiarity with
your computer. If it is difficult, take the time to read and study and get through it, because until you can
do these very basic things you will find it difficult to get much programming done.
If someone tells you to stop at a specific exercise in this labs or to skip certain ones, you should ignore
that person. Anyone trying to hide knowledge from you, or worse, make you get it from them instead of
through your own efforts, is trying to make you depend on them for your skills. Don’t listen to them, and
do the exercises anyway so that you learn how to educate yourself.
A programmer will eventually tell you to use macOS or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they’ll tell you to get a macOS computer. If he likes control and has a huge beard, he will tell you to install Linux. Again, use
whatever computer you have right now that works. All you need is an editor, a Terminal, and Python.
Finally, the purpose of this setup helps you do three things very reliably while you work on the exercises:

1. Write exercises using the text editor.
2. Run the exercises you wrote.
3. Fix them when they are broken.
4. Repeat.

Anything else will only confuse you, so stick to the plan.
